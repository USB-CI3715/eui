## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Wrapper Container for Disabled Items:**
  - Introduced a higher-level wrapper with `cursor: not-allowed` to properly indicate the disabled status of items.
  - Added the `default_item_action.styles.ts` file to house additional styles for this and potential future enhancements.

### Removed
- **Native `title` Option for Disabled Items:**
  - Removed condition to show tooltip when action item is disabled.
  - Removed the display of the native `title` attribute when an item is disabled.

### Fixed
- **`not-allowed` Cursor Behavior:**
  - Addressed an issue where the `user-select: none` property was overriding the `not-allowed` status. The solution involved applying the cursor style to the wrapper container, ensuring the correct cursor is displayed.

### Visual Improvements
- Enhanced the disabled state representation with clear visual feedback, including the proper cursor icon and simplified styles.
