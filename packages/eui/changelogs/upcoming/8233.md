**Enhancement**

- Updated `EuiModal`
    - Introduced support for passing the onClose prop to child components dynamically.
    - Enhanced flexibility by using React.Children.map and React.cloneElement to inject the onClose functionality into child elements where applicable.

- Updated `EuiModalHeader`
    - Added an accessible close button (EuiButtonIcon) integrated directly within the header.
    - Introduced an optional onClose prop to enable parent-driven modal closing functionality.
